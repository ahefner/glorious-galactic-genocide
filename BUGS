Serious issues:


Medium issues:
* Further improve packset allocation (reclaim freed blocks, chain packstacks, random eviction?)



Minor issues:
* Improve text layout
* Space and Enter should also step through modal contexts where left click is used presently
* Escape should close panels
* Better art for bottom panels



Resolved serious issues:
* Starmap floating point underflow
* Planet panel not updating on turn end



Resolved medium issues:
* Leaking label images in status bar (for year and population)


Resolved minor issues:
* Starmap scrolling feels gritty
* Fix quantization of scroll coordinates when zoomed beyond 100%
* Slow convergence when scrolling/zooming (clamp, or add small linear component)
* After founding new colony, switch to colony panel.
* Star exploration stops working in subsequent games using debug key 'G'
? Intermittent INVALID_OPERATION errors on fglrx that seem bogus. Kludge around and ignore it.
