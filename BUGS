Serious issues:
* Packset repack thrashing
* [WIN] OpenGL context trashed on resize
* [WIN] Invalid enum, crashes on no GL driver (check renderer = "GDI Generic")
* Better error handling / recording.


Medium issues:
* Further improve packset allocation (reclaim freed blocks, chain packstacks, random eviction?)
* Starmap select choice when multiple objects under cursor
* Starmap uncomfortable at minimum screen resolution (center on click? Scale down icons?)
* Can't recall fleets after launch (can change destination, but not recall them to the present star)


Minor issues:
* Doubled sound effect when clicking "Next Turn" with star-panel open
* Improve text layout
* Space and Enter should also step through modal contexts where left click is used presently
* Escape should close panels
* Deflect ships from each other?
* Fix fringe around normal mapped sprites
* Who is responsible for freeing ship labels? We should ditch that and add a system of flushable labels, GCed when packset allocation fails. Maybe just make global labels flushable, since they are.
* Invert text/selected color in tech panel (white not being the selected item is confusing when there's only two techs)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resolved serious issues:
* Starmap floating point underflow
* Planet panel not updating on turn end



Resolved medium issues:
* Leaking label images in status bar (for year and population)


Resolved minor issues:
* Starmap scrolling feels gritty
* Fix quantization of scroll coordinates when zoomed beyond 100%
* Slow convergence when scrolling/zooming (clamp, or add small linear component)
* After founding new colony, switch to colony panel.
* Star exploration stops working in subsequent games using debug key 'G'
* Don't allow selecting ships within fleets you don't control
? Intermittent INVALID_OPERATION errors on fglrx that seem bogus. Kludge around and ignore it.

TODO, High priority:
* Free per-game (nonglobal) resources at end of a game

TODO, Medium priority:
* Sliding selection of ship quantity in fleet panel
* Planet planet should display requirements for colonization (how to fit this at at 800x480?)

TODO, Low priority:
* Better inferno planet graphic
* Better art for bottom panels
* Sound effect manager that ensures the same sound isn't played twice simultaneously or in close succession
